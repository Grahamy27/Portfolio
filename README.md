Portfolio- Graham McCullough
I built this portfolio to showcase all of my projects for all future employers to view.
I am including all of my work from when i first began coding right up to my latest projects so that future employers can see where I began and how far I have come.
Within this portfolio I have listed my conatct details as well as a recent picture of myself.
I have also linked my github account.
The portfolio will be updated as I complete further projects.
I have provided clickable links that will take you to certain sections of my page and also if you click on boxes there will be links to my previous projects.
